            Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, 
            he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine's visit. 
            The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, 
            of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be</span><span style="line-height:.6;"> alone with Jane, proposed 
            their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the habit of </span><span style="line-height:.8;">walking; Mary could never 
            spare time; but the remaining five set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them. 
            They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to </span><span style="line-height:1;">entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty 
            was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps 
            he might be doing the same. </span>
          </p>
          <p><span style="line-height:1;">They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion 
            for making it a general</span><span style="line-height:1.1;"> concern, when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the moment 
            for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was high, she immediately said:</span>
            </p>
        </section>
          <p><span style="line-height:1.2; letter-spacing:2px;"><em>"Mr. Darcy,</em> I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much 
            I may be wounding yours. I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my </span><span style="line-height:1.5; letter-spacing:2px;">poor sister. 
            Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known 
            to the rest of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express."
          </p></span>
          <p class="alignright">
            <span style="line-height: 1.7;letter-spacing:2px;"><em>I am sorry, exceedingly sorry," </em> replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise and emotion, "that you have ever been 
            informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted."</span>
          </p>
          <p><span style="line-height: 1.9;letter-spacing:2px;">"You must not blame my aunt. Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, 
            I could not rest till I knew the particulars.<em> Let me thank you again and again,</em> in the name of all my family, for that<em> generous 
            compassion </em> which induced you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering them."</span>
          </p>
          <p class="alignright"><span style="line-height: 1.8;letter-spacing:2px;">"If you will thank me," he replied, "let it be for yourself alone. That the wish of giving happiness to you might add
             force to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your family owe me nothing.
             Much as I respect them,<em> I believe I thought only of you."</em></span>
          </p>
          <p> <span style="line-height: 1.8;letter-spacing:2px;">Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause, her companion added, </p></span>
            <p class="alignright"><span style="line-height: 1.9;letter-spacing:2px;">"You are too generous to trifle with me. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. 
            <em>My affections and wishes are unchanged, <span style="font-size:1.3rem">but one word from you will silence me on this subject forever."</span></em></span>
          </p>
          &nbsp;
          <p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak;
            and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, 
            since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The 
            </span><span style="line-height: 1.2;letter-spacing:1.5px;">happiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never felt before; and he expressed himself on the 
            occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth been able to 
            encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the </span><span style="line-height: 1;letter-spacing:2px;">expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his face, became
            him; but, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of feelings, which, in proving of what 
            importance she was to him, made his affection every moment more valuable.</span>

          </p>
          <p><span style="line-height: .9;">They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much to be thought, and felt, and said, for 
              attention to any other objects. She soon learnt that they were indebted</span><span style="line-height: .8;"> for their present good understanding to 
              the efforts of his aunt, who did call on him in her return through London, and there relate her journey to 
              Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every 
              expression of the latter which, in her ladyship's apprehension, peculiarly denoted her perverseness </span><span style="line-height:.8">and assurance; 
              in the belief that such </span><span style="line-height:.7">a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had 
              refused to give. But, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise. </span>
          </p>
          <p class="alignright"><span style="line-height:.7">"It taught me to hope," said he, "as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before. I knew enough of your 
              disposition to be certain that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have 
              acknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly."</span>
          </p>
          <p><span style="line-height:.6;">Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, "Yes, you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable 
            of that. After abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations."</span>
          </p>
          <p class="alignright"><span style="line-height: .6;">"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your accusations were ill-founded, formed on 
              mistaken premises, my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was unpardonable. 
              I cannot think of it without abhorrence."</span>
          </p>
          <p><span style="line-height: .5;">"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening," said Elizabeth. "The conduct 
              of neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved in civility."</span>
         </p>
        <p class="alignright"><span style="line-height: .5;">"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my 
            expressions during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your 
          </span><span style="line-height: .5;">reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner.' Those 
            were your words. You know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;â€”though it was some 
            time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice."</span>
        </p>
        <p><span style="line-height: .5;">"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way."</span>
        </p>
        <p class="alignright"><span style="line-height: .5;">"I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me."</p></span>
        <p><span style="line-height: .6;">"Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it."</span>
        </p>
        <p class="alignright"><span style="line-height: .6;">Darcy mentioned his letter. "Did it," said he, "did it soon make you think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?"</span>
        </p>
        <p><span style="line-height: .7;">She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her former <em>prejudices</em> had been removed.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="alignright"><span style="line-height: .7;">"I knew," said he, "that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me."</span>
        </p>
        <p><span style="line-height: .7;">"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies."</span>
        </p>
        <p class="alignright"><span style="line-height: .8;">"When I wrote that letter," replied Darcy, "I believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit."</p></span>
        <p><span style="line-height: .8;">"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure."
        </p></span>
        <p class="alignright"><span style="line-height: .8;">"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. Your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment arising from them is not of </span><span style="line-height: .9;">philosophy, but, what is much better, of innocence. But with me, it is not so. Painful recollections will intrude which cannot, which ought not, to be repelled. I have been a selfish being all </span><span style="line-height: 1;">my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a child I was taught what was right, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I was given good </span><span style="line-height: 1.2;">principles, but left to follow them in <em>pride</em> and conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only child), I was spoilt by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father, </span><span style="line-height: 1.3;">particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable), allowed, encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing; to care for none beyond </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">my own family circle; to think meanly of all the rest of the world; to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have </span>
        <span style="line-height: 1.8;">been but for you,<em> dearest, loveliest Elizabeth!</em> What do I not owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased."</span>
        </p>
        &nbsp;
        <p><span style="line-height: 1.4;">"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?"</span>
        </p>
        <p class="alignright"><span style="line-height: 1.2;">"Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses."
        </p></span>
        <p><span style="line-height: 1;">"My manners must have been in fault, <span style="line-height:.8;">but not intentionally, I assure you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong. </span><span style="line-height: 1;">How you must have hated me after that evening?"
        </p></span>
        <p class="alignright"><span style="line-height: 1;">"Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction."
        </p></span>
        <p><span style="line-height: 1.3;">"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?"
        </p></span>
        <p class="alignright"><span style="line-height: 1.3;">"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise."
        </p></span>
        <p><span style="line-height: 1.4;">"Your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you. My conscience told me that I deserved no </span><span style="line-height: 1.6;">extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive more than my due."</p></span>
        <p class="alignright"><span style="line-height: 1.6;">"My object then," replied Darcy, "was to show you, by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill </span><span style="line-height:1.7;">opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you."
        </p></span>
        <p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden </span><span style="line-height: 1.3;">interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in </span><span style="line-height:1.2;">quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his </span><span style="line-height: 1;">gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.</p></span>
        <p><span style="line-height: 1;">She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on farther.After </span><span style="line-height: .9;">walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know </span><span style="line-height: .7;">anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it was time to be at home.
